---------------------------------------

Notes and Features:
* The Lunar lander was modeled in Blender and raytraced into 100 frames of
  rotation
* Terrain is a mesh exported from Blender and rendered via Three.js Canvas
  renderer
* Box2d Physics for collision detection between the edges of the terrain mesh
  and the lander
* Missile bases are parsed from bone positions in the mesh so that they can be
  positioned inside blender
* Missile bases explode after you land on them  
* Three different levels/terrain meshes


To run it locally, clone the repository and run python -m SimpleHTTPServer from the www directory,
then point your browser at http://localhost:8000


Notes for development:
* To export the level mesh to Threejs format you will need to copy the exporter
plugin from the ThreeJs source directory into the appropriate directory in
the blender distribution
* UV mapping for the terrain is done in Blender, so you need to update the UV
mesh every time you change the mesh
