A Lunar Lander Game
===================
It's not rocket science, just Html5 ...
---------------------------------------


This little demonstration game is in early stages of production. Working features:

* The Lunar lander was modeled in Blender and raytraced into 100 frames of
  rotation
* Terrain is a mesh exported from Blender
* Box2d Physics for collision detection between the edges of the terrain mesh
  and the lander, but the lander collision mesh needs more work
* Works with ThreeJs' WebGLRenderer and canvas renderer


To run it, clone the repository and run python -m SimpleHTTPServer from the www directory,
then point your browser at http://localhost:8000


Notes:
* To export the level mesh to threejs format you will need to copy the exporter
plugin from the ThreeJs source directory into the appropriate directory in
the blender distribution
* UV mapping for the terrain is done in Blender, so you need to update the UV
mesh every time you change the mesh
